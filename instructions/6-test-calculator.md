# Calculator

This is a basic calculator program that lets you practice taking inputs from the user and doing different things, based on what those inputs are.

## Task

Create a program that mimics a calculator. It should ask the user for two numbers, and then an operator (+, -, * , or /) and output the result.

## Examples

`What is the first number?` 2

`What is the second number?` 3

`What would you like to do to 2 and 3?` *

`2 times 2 is 6`

---

`What is the first number?` 10

`What is the second number?` 5

`What would you like to do to 10 and 5?` /

`10 divided by 5 is 2`

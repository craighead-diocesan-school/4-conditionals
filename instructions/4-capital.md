# Capital

This project is the basis for a quiz. It lets you practice checking if the user is right about a question you've programmed.

## Task

Create a program that asks for the user's name and then asks them (using their name) what the capital of France is. Tell them whether they got it correct or not, using their name again.

## Examples

`What is your name?` Jane

`Hi Jane. Quick question: what is the capital of France?` London

`I'm sorry, Jane. That's incorrect.`

`What is your name?` Jane

`Hi Jane. Quick question: what is the capital of France?` Paris

`Correct, Jane.`

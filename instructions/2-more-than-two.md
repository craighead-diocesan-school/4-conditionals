# Is It More Than 2?

This simple program is useless - apart from helping you practice using `if` statements (conditionals).

## Task

Create a program that compares a number to 2 and outputs whether it's more or not.

## Examples

`Your number:` 3

`Your number is more than 2`

---

`Your number?` 1

`Your number is less than 2`

## Extension

Use the user's number again in the output.

`Your number?` 1

`1 is less than 2`
